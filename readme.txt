== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why allow lower level users to view private posts and pages? =

This won't fit everyone's situation, but sometimes you want visitors to be authenticated in order to read material.  This will allow you to 
define who can view these posts.

= Does privatePlus work with Private Pages as well as Private Posts?  =

This plugin does handle private pages, users of the appropriate level 
will be able to view pages that are marked as private. You may need to 
adjust the code in your template for your page navigation.

= What versions of WordPress is privatePlus compatible with? =

privatePlus has been tested with version 2.3 and 2.5 of WordPress.  It 
may work with other versions, but I have not tested them in those 
systems.
